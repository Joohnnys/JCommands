# JCommands
A very simple plugin for add, set and remove custom commands in your Minecraft Server


Commands:
```
/JCmds TYPE [add/set/del] COMMAND [message/alias]
Types: message(msg) / aliases(alias)

If you want set a lined message use:
/JCmds msg set COMMAND line # MESSAGE
Change # to line number

/JCmds disable COMMAND
/JCmds enable COMMAND
/JCmds reload
```

Commands it's very useful to create, set and remove custom commands in-game or in console,
but you can edit these commands on config.yml

[Config.yml](src/config.yml)
 
 
Permissions:
```
jcmds.admin - use to add permision to modify commands
```


It's very easy to use, it's simple!!!
  
I'm working a new version with new features like open external link when click on message.
